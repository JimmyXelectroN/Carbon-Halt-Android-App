# Carbon Halt Android App
This app helps the user keep track of their carbon footprint. Made using C# and Xamarin

**(Feel free to contribute to this project as there is lots to improve. For one if we can get better estimations for the calculator, that would be great. Create a branch and add features that you think will be useful. All and any help is welcome and wanted.)**
